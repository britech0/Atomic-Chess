# Hello! Welcome to my atomic chess game in python. 
#This game is meant to be played entirely in the terminal with two players or by oneself.

# HOW MOVE IN ATOMIC CHESS:
#Run the python file
#You will be prompted to enter a move, use the visualized board in the terminal to move your piece.
#For example, for the 1st input, type the location of the piece to move.
#2nd input will be the destination
#After a valid move, it will be the other player's turn.


# SPECIAL RULE:
#When a piece is captured the surrounding squares explode, killing pieces. If a King piece is killed, then the player delivering the final move will win the game!
